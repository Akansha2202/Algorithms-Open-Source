# Algorithms-Open-Source

This project is a collection of implementations of various algorithms in various programming languages. These algorithms are useful and relatively simple, and are recommended to be implemented by any computer science student.  

## Motivation
The motivation for this project is this [reddit post]( https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/fuaudc/10_algorithms_every_computer_science_student_must/)  

## Want to Contribute?

- Have a look at the [issues](https://github.com/yashasvi-goel/Algorithms-Open-Source/issues)
- Select an issue you want to work on
- Comment with the language of choice, after which you will get assigned to that issue.
    + Only then start working on the task.
- If the algorithm of your choice is already implemented, try to optimise it.
- Make sure to add your algorithm to the README if it does not currently exist there.

**Note: It is encouraged to implement already implemented algorithms in different languages.**
