# Algorithms-Open-Source

This project is a collection of implementations of various algorithms in various programming languages. These algorithms are useful and relatively simple, and are recommended to be implemented by any computer science student.  

## Motivation
The motivation for this project is this [reddit post]( https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/fuaudc/10_algorithms_every_computer_science_student_must/)  

## Want to Contribute?

Have a look at the issues.

Select the issue you want to work on, comment with the language of choice after which you would get assigned. Only then start working on the task.

If the Algorithm of your choice is already implemented here, try to optimise it.

Get to work!
