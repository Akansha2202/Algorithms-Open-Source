# Algorithms-Open-Source

The motivation for this project is this [reddit post]( https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/fuaudc/10_algorithms_every_computer_science_student_must/)


## Want to Contribute?

Have a look at the issues.

Select the issue you want to work on, comment with the language of choice after which you would get assigned. Only then start working on the task.

If the Algorithm of your choice is already implemented here, try to optimise it.

Get to work!
